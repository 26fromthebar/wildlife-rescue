This project is a one page static website and was created using HTML, CSS and SASS and can be visited at https://wildlife-rescue-collective.herokuapp.com/.
It was built during the online lesson of Jonas Schmedtmann "Advanced CSS and Sass".
The general layout and typography was based on Jonas' ideas, but the content and some of the components are totally different.
